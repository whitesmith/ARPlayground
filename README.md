WS INTERACTIVE INSTALATION WALL
================================
The purpose of this repo is to create a canvas inside an AR element.
Once that is possible, there will be several AR markers with a separate canvas in each one, so that together they make a huge canvas in which people can interact and play.
<br>

Current state
================================
On the debug.html and cam.js file I've managed to show a white canvas when shown the marker to the camera.
The next steps are being able to switch cameras on mobile devices (<i>issue</i>), and being able to draw on the shown camera by click or touch.
<br>


Steps
================================
1 - Connecting the camera to the Js Library and showing a plain canvas <br>
2 - Switching camera output on mobile devices(frontal or rear)<br>
3 - Drawing on canvas with click or touch <br>
4 - Saving the drawing to be able to continue on another session<br>
5 - Aplying a colorpicker to choose line color<br>
6 - Aplying a rubber to delete <br>
7 - Aplying a StrokeWidth controler <br>
8 - Studying the marker size in order to be able to see the AR element a few meters away from the wall <br>
9 - Making a portion of the available space for outside people to draw (Possibility of seeing the portion where they're drawing and also the bigger picture)<br>

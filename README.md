WS INTERACTIVE INSTALATION WALL
================================
The purpose of this repo is to create a canvas inside an AR element.
Once that is possible, there will be several AR markers with a separate canvas in each one, so that together they make a huge canvas in which people can interact and play.
<br>
<b>This only works on Chrome </b>
